  - Enhanced error categorization and logging for API failures
- **Impact:** Robust API handling preventing quota-related failures
- **Production Ready:** System now handles API limits gracefully with automatic retry

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED - Vivo Price Extraction Accuracy:**
- **Issue:** Vivo US price extraction showing $159.99 instead of correct $119.99
- **Root cause:** Generic selectors matching "From $159.99" in related product sections rather than main product price
- **Resolution:**
  - Enhanced selectors with product area specificity (.product__price .price__regular.heading.whitespace-nowrap)
  - Added ID-based targeting ([id*='Price-'] .price__regular.heading.whitespace-nowrap)
  - Implemented fallback selector hierarchy for robustness
- **Impact:** Accurate Vivo price extraction now confirmed at $119.99
- **Verification:** HTML analysis and logs confirm correct price targeting

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED - Critical Function Signature Bugs:**
- **Issue:** `extract_price()` and `is_in_stock()` functions had critical bugs causing AttributeError crashes when config=None parameter was passed
- **Resolution:** Fixed function signatures to properly handle config=None with graceful fallback to global config instance
- **Impact:** This was the root cause of most "price not found" failures - CSS selectors were working correctly but functions were crashing before execution
- **Test Status:** All functions now work with both config parameter and None fallback

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED - CSS Selector Research Complete:**
- **Previous assumption:** CSS selectors were broken and needed research
- **Reality discovered:** CSS selectors were working perfectly (finding 22-25 Amazon price elements with correct $130.99 extraction)
- **Root cause:** Function crashes prevented selector execution, not selector accuracy
- **Current status:** Amazon selectors work flawlessly, extracting prices like $129.99, $130.99 correctly

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED - Blocking Detection False Positives:**
- **Issue:** Generic "blocked" word in Amazon content was triggering false positive blocking detection
- **Resolution:** Refined blocking indicators in `selectors.json` to remove overly generic terms
- **Impact:** Eliminated false blocking detections while maintaining security
- **Test Status:** Debug tools confirm proper blocking detection without false positives

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED - Processing Logic Issues:**
- **Issue:** Despite successful price extraction, all log entries showed "Status: Failed" with "Message: Price not found / Out of stock"
- **Root cause:** Logic was checking for `float("inf")` but function returned `None`, and out-of-stock items were correctly filtered out
- **Resolution:**
  - Improved logic to distinguish between "price not found", "out of stock", and successful updates
  - Enhanced logging with more descriptive messages
  - Fixed status determination logic to properly handle None returns
- **Impact:** Now correctly logs "Out of stock" vs "Price not found" vs successful price updates

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED - Complete Test Suite:**
- **Achievement:** 32 tests now pass successfully, up from broken test suite

- **Detailed debug output:** Comprehensive logging of selector attempts, price extraction, stock detection
- **Error categorization:** Clear distinction between network errors, blocking, parsing failures

## Historical Context: Major Issues Resolved

### **The CSS Selector Investigation (August 2025):**
What started as "CSS selector problems" revealed a deeper architectural issue:
1. **Initial symptom:** Prices not being extracted despite script running
2. **Investigation revealed:** CSS selectors were working perfectly (22-25 elements found, correct prices extracted)
3. **Root cause discovered:** Function signature bugs causing crashes before selectors could execute
4. **Lesson learned:** Always investigate the full execution path, not just the visible symptoms

### **The Blocking Detection Refinement:**
Original blocking detection was too aggressive:
1. **Problem:** Normal Amazon content containing word "blocked" triggered false positives
2. **Solution:** Refined blocking indicators to be more specific and context-aware
3. **Result:** Eliminated false positives while maintaining protection against actual blocking

### **The Processing Logic Enhancement:**
Logic improvements for better user understanding:
1. **Old behavior:** All failures logged as "Price not found / Out of stock" regardless of actual reason
2. **New behavior:** Distinct messages for "Price not found", "Out of stock", and "Sheet update error"
3. **Impact:** Users can now understand exactly why updates fail and take appropriate action

## Completed Major Milestones
